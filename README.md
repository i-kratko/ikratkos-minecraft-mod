# ikratkos-minecraft-mod
This is a Minecraft mod (or rather a trial). I just want to experiment with modding. I am using the fabricmc example mod as a base for this one. You han find it here: https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-example-mod
!KEEP IN MIND IF YOU WANT TO INSPECT THE CODE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO ACCCESS ONLY THE STUFF I HAVE UPLOADED, FOR SOME REASON I CANT UPLOAD ALL THE FOLDERS!
